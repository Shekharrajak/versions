====================
Older Array Packages
====================

Below is a very brief history of NumPy and the array packages that were important
to its development. These older array packages are no longer maintained, and users
are strongly advised to use NumPy for any array-related purposes or refactor any
pre-existing code to utilize the NumPy library.

History of NumPy
================

NumPy derives from an old library called Numeric, which was the first array object
built for Python. It was quite successful and was used in a variety of applications
before being phased out. NumPy also incorporates features introduced by a library
called Numarray, which was written after Numeric but before NumPy.

When NumPy was first written, it wasn't actually called "NumPy". For about 6 months at
the end of 2005, NumPy was called SciPy Core (not to be confused with the full SciPy
package which remains a `separate <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ package). However, it was
decided in January 2006 to go with the historical name of NumPy for the new package.
